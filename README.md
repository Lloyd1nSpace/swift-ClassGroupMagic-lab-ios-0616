Let's get started!

### `Tiger`

Let's start off easy: By implementing a simple class called `Tiger`. The `Tiger` you implement in this lab is pretty basic: It has a name, and it is either hungry or not hungry, just like tigers in the real world.

1. Create the `Tiger.swift` file and define a class called `Tiger`.
2. Add two properties to your `Tiger` class:
	1. A `String` property called `name`
	2. A `Bool` property called `isHungry`
3. Create an initializer for this class. This class should take one parameter of type `String` called `name`, and assign that parameter to the appropriate property. `isHungry` should be `true` by default.
4. Implement a method called `eat()`. This method takes no parameters. It should change `isHungry` to `false`. 

### `Coordinate`

With that simple task out of the way, let's switch gears a bit. For the rest of this lab, you're going to implement a few classes to represent a pizza delivery service. This isn't any ordinary pizza delivery service, though. This is an intercontinental pizza delivery service that can deliver pizzas up to 5000 kilometers away.

The first thing you have to do, though, is create a class that can represent a coordinate somewhere on Earth. Coordinates are made up of latitude/longitude points. These points are `Double`s.

1. Create the  `Coordinate.swift` file and declare a class called `Coordinate`.
2. Add two stored properties:
	1. A `Double` called `latitude`
	2. Another `Double` called `longitude`
3. Add four _computed_ properties:
	1. A `Bool` called `isInNorthernHemisphere`. This returns `true` if the coordinate is in the Northern Hemisphere. (A coordinate is in the Northern Hemisphere if its latitude is positive.)
	2. A `Bool` called `isInSouthernHemisphere`. This returns `true` if the coordinate is in the Souther Hemisphere. (A coordinate is in the Souther Hemisphere if its latitude is negative.)
	3. A `Bool` called `isInWesternHemisphere`. This returns `true` if the coordinate is in the Western Hemisphere. (A coordinate is in the Western Hemisphere if its longitude is positive.)
	4. A `Bool` called `isInEasternHemisphere`. This returns `true` if the coordinate is in the Eastern Hemisphere. (A coordinate is in the Eastern Hemisphere if its longitude is negative.)
4. Create a method called `distanceTo()`. This method takes one parameter called `coordinate`. This parameter is another `Coordinate` class. `distanceTo()` should return the distance, in kilometers, between the two points.
	1. The distance between two coordinates requires some hairy math. The formula is **acos(sin(latitude<sub>1</sub>) * sin(latitude<sub>2</sub>) + cos(latitude<sub>1</sub>) * cos(latitude<sub>2</sub>) * cos(longitude<sub>1</sub>-longitude<sub>2</sub>)) * 6371000 / 1000**. `acos()` and `sin()` are both functions you can call in Swift.
	2. `latitude` and `longitude` need to be converted to _radians_. A `radians` property has been created for you to do this, so you can call `latitude.radians` to get the latitude in radians.

### `PizzaDeliveryService`

Next, you have to create a class to represent a pizza delivery service.

1. Create the `PizzaDeliveryService.swift` file and declare a class called `PizzaDeliveryService`.
2. Your `PizzaDeliveryService` class should have two properties:
	1. A `Coordinate` called `location` that represents where the pizza delivery service is located.
	2. An `Int` called `pizzasAvailable`. This should be a _variable_. It represents the service's inventory.
3. Create an initializer that takes one parameter, a `Coordinate` called `location`, and assigns it to the `location` property. It should also make sure the `pizzasAvailable` property is initially set to `10`.
4. Create a method called `isInRange()`. This method takes one parameter, a `Coordinate` called `destination`, and returns `true` if the destination is no more than 5000 kilometers from the pizza delivery service.
5. Create a method called `deliverPizzaTo()`. This method takes one parameter, a `Coordinate` called `destination`. If the destination is in range of the pizza delivery service, it subtracts one from the number of pizzas available and returns `true`. Otherwise, it simply returns `false`. If there are no pizzas available, it also returns `false`.

### `Person`

Finally, you have to create a `Person` class, so someone can eat all these pizzas.

1. Create a `Person.swift` file and declare a new class called `Person`.
2. Add four properties to your `Person` class:
	1. A `String` called `firstName`
	2. A `String` called `lastName`
	3. A `Coordinate` called `home`
	4. A `Bool` called `isHungry`
3. Create an initializer that takes three parameters: a `String` called `firstName`, a `String` called `lastName`, and a `Coordinate` called `home`. These parameters should be assigned to the appropriate properties. `isHungry` should initially be set to `true`.
4. Create a method called `eatPizzaFrom()`. This method takes one parameter, a `PizzaDeliveryService` called `service` that represents where the pizza is being ordered from. If the person is hungry _and_ the service is in range of the person's home, then the `isHungry` property should be set to `false` and the method should return `true`. If the person is not hungry or the service is not in range of the person's home, the method should simply return `false`.
